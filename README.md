In this project, I have created a Certificate generator using front-end framework named "Streamlit".

What does it do?
--You can type your name in the Input Box and upload a dummy certificate without name on it.
--The code will put your name on the dummy certificate
--You can adjust the font, size of the text.
--Once Done, you can simply download the certificate
