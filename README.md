In this project, I have created a Certificate generator which allows you to print text on the certificate without manually doing it. With some little changes in the source code, you can also automate the certificate creation work for your organization.

<b>How does it work?</b></br>
--You can type your name in the Input Box and upload a dummy certificate without name on it.</br>
--The code will put your name on the dummy certificate</br>
--You can adjust the font, size of the text.</br>
--Once Done, you can simply download the certificate</br>

<b>Languages and Frameworks used:</b></br>
--Python, OpenCV, NumPy and Streamlit(for web app)
<br><br>
<b>Inputs Parameters:</b>
1. Name - Enter your name
2. Select Font - Select font you want your text to be in.
3. Select Font Size - Select the font size of the text in the range of 0.5 to 7.
4. Select the number - Decides the intensity of your text with 1 being the least up till 5.
5. Enter X-coordinate, Enter Y-coordinate - the X and Y coordinate where image has to be placed.
6. Upload file: Upload the dummy certificate without name on it.

Once you have entered all the values correctly, the certificate will be generated and you can see the preview of it as well below the Submit button. You can also download that certificate by clicking on "Download" button.
